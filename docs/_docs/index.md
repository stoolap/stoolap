# Stoolap Documentation

Welcome to the Stoolap Documentation! This is your comprehensive guide to using and understanding Stoolap, a high-performance HTAP database written in pure Go.

## What is Stoolap?

Stoolap is a Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database engine that combines transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) capabilities in a single system. Built entirely in Go with zero external dependencies, Stoolap features a row-based version store for efficient OLTP operations and columnar indexing for optimized analytical queries, providing a unified solution for diverse workloads.
