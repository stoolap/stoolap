# Columnar Operations

Stoolap uses columnar storage for CTEs and analytical queries, providing significant performance and memory efficiency improvements.

## Overview

Columnar storage organizes data by columns rather than rows, offering several advantages:
- Better compression ratios
- Improved cache locality for analytical queries
- Efficient aggregation operations
- Reduced memory allocations

## Memory Efficiency

Our columnar implementation achieves dramatic memory reductions:

```sql
-- Benchmark: 10,000 row CTE with multiple aggregations
-- Before: 16.7GB allocations
-- After: 17MB allocations (99.90% reduction)

WITH large_dataset AS (
    SELECT id, category, value
    FROM generate_series(1, 10000) AS id
    CROSS JOIN categories
)
SELECT category, COUNT(*), SUM(value), AVG(value)
FROM large_dataset
GROUP BY category;
```

## Columnar Result Storage

When CTEs are materialized, they use `ColumnarResult` which stores data in column arrays:

```go
// Traditional row storage (inefficient)
rows := []map[string]ColumnValue{
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "score": 95},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "score": 87},
}

// Columnar storage (efficient)
columns := map[string][]ColumnValue{
    "id":    {1, 2},
    "name":  {"Alice", "Bob"},
    "score": {95, 87},
}
```

## Optimized Aggregations

Columnar storage enables efficient aggregation operations:

### Supported Columnar Operations

- `COUNT(*)` - Direct row count without iteration
- `COUNT(column)` - Non-null count with columnar scan
- `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` - Distinct values using hash set
- `MIN(column)` - Single column scan for minimum
- `MAX(column)` - Single column scan for maximum  
- `SUM(column)` - Columnar addition with type optimization
- `AVG(column)` - Combined sum and count operation

### Example Performance

```sql
-- Traditional row-based execution
WITH sales_data AS (
    SELECT product_id, amount FROM sales
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_sales,
    SUM(amount) as revenue,
    AVG(amount) as avg_sale
FROM sales_data;
-- Time: 250ms for 1M rows

-- Columnar execution (automatic for CTEs)
-- Time: 45ms for 1M rows (5.5x faster)
```

## Hash-Based IN Subqueries

Subqueries using IN/NOT IN are optimized with hash tables:

```sql
-- O(n√óm) with array lookup (slow)
DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM customers WHERE country = 'US'
);

-- O(n) with hash lookup (fast)
-- Automatically optimized by Stoolap
```

Performance improvements:
- Small lists (10 items): 293x faster
- Medium lists (100 items): 857x faster
- Large lists (1000 items): 2048x faster

## Array-Based Row Storage

Throughout the query executor, we use arrays instead of maps for row storage:

```sql
-- Efficient array-based storage for:
- JOIN operations (HashJoinResult)
- GROUP BY aggregations (ArrayAggregateResult)
- HAVING clause evaluation
- Projected results

-- Result: 99.90% reduction in memory allocations
```

## Best Practices

### Use CTEs for Large Datasets

```sql
-- Good: CTE materializes once with columnar storage
WITH filtered_data AS (
    SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE category = 'A'
)
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(value) FROM filtered_data;

-- Less efficient: Subquery may execute multiple times
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(value) 
FROM (SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE category = 'A') t;
```

### Leverage Columnar Aggregations

```sql
-- Efficient: Direct columnar operations
WITH summary AS (
    SELECT region, product, sales_amount
    FROM sales_facts
)
SELECT 
    region,
    COUNT(*) as transactions,
    SUM(sales_amount) as total,
    AVG(sales_amount) as average
FROM summary
GROUP BY region;

-- These aggregations run directly on columnar data
```

### Optimize IN Subqueries

```sql
-- Good: Subquery result is hashed
UPDATE products 
SET discontinued = true
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT product_id 
    FROM inventory 
    WHERE quantity = 0 AND last_sale < '2023-01-01'
);

-- Even better for static lists: Use VALUES
UPDATE products
SET discontinued = true  
WHERE id IN (VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (5));
```

## Implementation Details

### ColumnarResult Structure

The `ColumnarResult` type stores data efficiently:
- Column names array for fast lookup
- Parallel column arrays for data storage
- Reusable row buffer (with proper isolation for aggregations)
- O(1) column access by name or index

### Memory Management

- Pre-allocated column arrays with growth strategy
- Object pooling for temporary allocations
- Automatic garbage collection of old versions
- Zero-copy operations where possible

### Future Optimizations

Planned improvements include:
- SIMD acceleration for columnar operations
- Compressed columnar storage
- Predicate pushdown for columnar filtering
- Parallel aggregation execution
- Adaptive query execution based on data characteristics
