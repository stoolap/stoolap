# Quick Start: Using Subqueries in Stoolap

This guide provides a quick introduction to using subqueries in Stoolap SQL statements.

## What are Subqueries?

Subqueries are SQL queries nested within another query. They allow you to use the result of one query as input for another, enabling more complex data operations.

## Basic IN Subquery Example

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the power of subqueries:

```sql
-- Create sample tables
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    country TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    total FLOAT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO customers VALUES 
    (1, 'Alice', 'USA'),
    (2, 'Bob', 'Canada'),
    (3, 'Charlie', 'USA');

INSERT INTO orders VALUES 
    (1, 1, 100.0),
    (2, 2, 200.0),
    (3, 1, 150.0);

-- Find all orders from US customers using a subquery
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA'
);
-- Returns orders 1 and 3 (Alice's orders)
```

## EXISTS/NOT EXISTS Example

Check if related records exist without retrieving them:

```sql
-- Find customers who have placed at least one order
SELECT name FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
);

-- Find customers who have never ordered
SELECT name FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
);
```

## Scalar Subqueries Example

Use subqueries that return a single value in comparisons:

```sql
-- Find orders above average
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE total > (SELECT AVG(total) FROM orders);

-- Delete old records below a threshold
DELETE FROM logs
WHERE timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM logs WHERE priority = 'high');
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Filtering Based on Another Table

```sql
-- Delete inactive user data
DELETE FROM user_sessions 
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE last_login < DATE('now', '-90 days')
);
```

### 2. Bulk Updates Based on Conditions

```sql
-- Apply discount to premium category products
UPDATE products 
SET discount = 0.20 
WHERE category_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM categories WHERE tier = 'premium'
);
```

### 3. Finding Missing Records

```sql
-- Find customers without any orders
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders
);
```

### 4. Existence Checks

```sql
-- Update product availability
UPDATE products
SET in_stock = false
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM inventory WHERE product_id = products.id AND quantity > 0
);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep subqueries simple**: Complex subqueries can impact performance
2. **Use indexes**: Ensure columns used in subquery WHERE clauses are indexed
3. **Consider alternatives**: Sometimes a JOIN might be more efficient than a subquery

## Current Support

Stoolap currently supports:
- ✅ IN and NOT IN subqueries
- ✅ EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators
- ✅ Scalar subqueries (returning single values)
- ✅ Non-correlated subqueries (independent of outer query)
- ✅ Subqueries in SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements

Coming soon:
- ❌ Correlated subqueries (referencing outer query)
- ❌ Subqueries in FROM clause
- ❌ Subqueries in SET clause of UPDATE
- ❌ ANY and ALL operators
